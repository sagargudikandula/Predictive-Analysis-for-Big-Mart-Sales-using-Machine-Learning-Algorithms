    Currently, supermarket run-centres, Big Marts keep track of each individual item's sales data in order to anticipate potential consumer demand and update inventory management. Anomalies and general trends are often discovered by mining the data warehouse's data store. For retailers like Big Mart, the resulting data can be used to forecast future sales volume using various machine learning techniques like big mart. A predictive model was developed using Xgboost, Linear regression, Polynomial regression, and Ridge regression techniques for forecasting the sales of a business such as Big -Mart, and it was discovered that the model outperforms existing models.
    In this study, we propose a methodology that utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict sales in Big Mart, a large retail chain. By leveraging historical sales data and incorporating various features such as product attributes, store locations, and time-related variables, our approach aims to generate accurate sales forecasts and provide valuable insights for decision-making. To evaluate the performance of the models, we adopt metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. Additionally, cross-validation techniques are employed to assess the robustness and generalizability of the models. By comparing the results obtained from different algorithms, we identify the most effective approach for predicting sales in the Big Mart retail chain.
